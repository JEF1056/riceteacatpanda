That's Some Interesting Tea(rs)........
-------------------------------------------

You know, the tears of one's enemies works lovely in tea. Turns out, there's tons of different bases for tea. In fact, I think I heard Delphine talk about this chef website she used for her tea base combinations...

Oh! Speaking of which, GIANt wants Delphine to make him tea... all he has is the tea leaves and the cup though. Maybe you can help Delphine, since she's really busy with cooking other things?
